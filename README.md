# Engine Rating Prediction 

This project features a Python script that predicts engine ratings based on inspection parameters 
exclusively derived from the provided dataset, contributing valuable insights to the automotive industry.

# Objective

Your task is to write a small Python script that predicts the engine rating based on the inspection 
parameters using only the provided dataset. You need to find all the cases/outliers where the rating has been 
given incorrectly as compared to current condition of the engine.
This task is designed to test your Python ability, your knowledge of Data Science techniques, 
your ability to find trends, outliers, relative importance of variables with deviation in target variable 
and your ability to work effectively, efficiently and independently within a commercial setting.
This task is designed as well to test your hyper-tuning abilities or lateral thinking.
